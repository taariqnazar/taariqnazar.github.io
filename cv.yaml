summary: > 
  I’m an ML researcher and PhD student in Mathematical Statistics at
  Stockholm University. My work sits at the intersection of information theory and
  machine learning: one line develops geometric views of information in supervised
  learning; another explores how information-theoretic ideas shape reinforcement
  learning. Beyond research, I build production-grade, real-time NLP/time-series
  pipelines for news-driven trading. I also enjoy hands-on
  engineering—electronics, robotics, and embedded systems—because I like systems
  that learn and things I can build end-to-end.

  I’m into systems that learn. Lately I’ve been working at the intersection of
  information theory and machine learning: one project develops a geometric view
  of information in supervised learning, another explores how information-theoretic
  ideas shape reinforcement learning. I also tinker with electronics, robotics,
  and embedded systems—I like to build things and write code.
